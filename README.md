# Joint Shapley values: a measure of joint feature importance

#### This repo contains the source code for the research paper <arxiv link goes here>. The paper proposes a _Joint Shapley_ value that extends the widely-used Shapley value, a key measure of feature importance in game theory. The Joint Shapley value can be used to establish the importance of coalitions of features, as well as individual features, whilst maintaining the axiomatic foundations of the original Shapley value.

#### What this repo contains
The `rotten-tomatoes-walktrhough.ipynb` Jupyter notebook is a walk-through of the Joint Shapley methodology described in the associated paper, using the [Rotten Tomatoes movie review database](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/).
The `datasets` folder contains datasets used in the notebooks:
  - `rt-polaritydata` contains the Rotten Tomatoes data. This is divided into positive reviews (`*.pos`) and negative reviews (`*.neg`). The 'mangled' suffix indicates that the order of the reviews has been scrambled.
