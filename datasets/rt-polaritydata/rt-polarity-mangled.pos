astonishing . . . [frames] profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment . 
take care is nicely performed by aaaa quintet of actresses , but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length . 
it's hard to fairly judge aaaa film like ringu when you've seen the remake first . many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity , [yet] are worthwhile .
